# RL TradingAgent
### A reinforcement learning agent which traids on the stock market.

## Overview
This project implements a reinforcement learning (RL) agent that learns how to trade a stock (e.g., MSFT) using daily price data. 
The agent is trained with PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) from the `stable-baselines3` library and operates in a custom 
Gymnasium environment.
